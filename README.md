### RuleEngine

![RuleEngine demonstration image](https://i.imgur.com/nm7KkQ1.png)

`RuleEngine` is a dynamic `rule` evaluation application, implemented in _GoLang_. 
This helps in mitigating drawbacks in more conventional `If-Else` rule evaluation, which are hard coded in application.
This hard coding make difficult to _Add_, _Update_ and _Delete_ rules.

`RuleEngine` will enable us define, parse, and evaluate rules flexibly.
